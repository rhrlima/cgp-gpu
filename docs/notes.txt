nf = number of functions genes
nc = number os column
nr = number of rows
ni = number of inputs (max arity)
no = number of outputs
a = arity
l = levels-back

3 parameters chosen by the user:
nc, nr and l

Ln = nc * nr = maximum number of computational nodes allowed

l = number of column (to the left) the node can get its inputs from. Ex l=1 can only get its inputs from the immediate left column or primary input. If l = nc, this allows the node to connect to any nodeon their left.

Allowed values for a function gene
0 <= fi <= nf

Allowed values for a gene Cij
if j >= l
	ni+(j-l) * nr <= Cij <= ni + j * nr
	

if j < l
	0 <= Cij <= ni + j * nr

Allowed values for Output connections
	0 <= Oi < ni + Ln
